# Scrapping-Facebook
The project is about (Web) Scrapping Facebook. The idea is:  
we need to look back at the last 100 posts of a particular user and see the number of likes on those posts. Create a list of those data. Also, we need to get a list of all the names (or facebook usernames) that had clicked the Like button, for a particular (pre defined) number of posts, and calculate the frequency a user (who belongs in the list) hits the Like button.
